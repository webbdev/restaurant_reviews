Sure, set menu is value proposition. Had the terrin as a starter and beef bourg. But both dishes decent, not great. The French bread is great however. And so is dessert. Despite food not being fantastic, will come again."

Prices reasonable, service excellent (many thanks to our great waiter Armine), and the meal was quite satisfactory. Overall, for us, an excellent choice."
