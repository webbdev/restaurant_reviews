            "comment": "It's all about the steak. Environs here are less posh than the one off Regent Street - smaller tables and less opulent & stuffy generally; pick according to your taste/mood. In common with Gaucho, sides are unjustifiably expensive - it's easy to add another ten quid on top of what it already a pretty pricey steak. I like it here, but it's of questionable value - go on a Monday night where BYOB is £5 corkage."
